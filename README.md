# Java DSA

This repository is a curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java. It's designed for learners, developers, and those preparing for interviews. The repository includes clean, well-documented code covering a wide range of sorting algorithms and is continuously expanding to include searching, recursion, trees, graphs, and more.
